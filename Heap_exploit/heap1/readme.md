* Check out the psuedo code in IDA

* WE can see that program has 4 funtion
* 1 create a heap
* 2 delete heap 
* 3 exit 
* 4 checkflag

* check flag will check if the the ponter of "check"  is point to any heap and and if check +8 ==0xabcdef it will call win and we get the flag
* testing with the program we can see that after we create a heap of 16byte and fill it with 8*A and 8*B
* then free it

* and this is the heap after we create a chunk of the same size 
* we can calculate the addres of "check"  to the bss section which contain our pointer to the heap is 16byte
* that mean check will pointo the 3th we allocate
* I will just put the script here
